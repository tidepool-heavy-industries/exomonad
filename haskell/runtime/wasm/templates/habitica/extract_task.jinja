{# extract_task.jinja
   PURPOSE: Extract a single actionable task from unstructured text
   EXPECTS: rawInput (Text)
   OUTPUT: JSON { description: string, context?: string }
#}

Extract ONE actionable task from this message.

<input>
{{ rawInput }}
</input>

<rules>
- Extract the CORE action, not meta-commentary ("I should..." → just the task)
- If multiple tasks mentioned, pick the most concrete/actionable one
- Strip filler words: "maybe", "I guess", "probably should"
- Keep context if it helps clarify (deadlines, people involved, location)
- If no clear task, use the full input as description
</rules>

<examples>
Input: "oh I need to remember to email sarah about the meeting tomorrow"
Output: {"description": "Email Sarah about meeting", "context": "tomorrow"}

Input: "buy milk eggs bread and also pick up dry cleaning"
Output: {"description": "Buy milk, eggs, bread", "context": "also: pick up dry cleaning"}

Input: "ugh I really should exercise more"
Output: {"description": "Exercise", "context": null}
