# Development Session

You are a **Dev agent** but no issue context was detected.

This can happen if:
- You're on main branch (not a gh-* worktree)
- The issue number couldn't be parsed from your branch name
- The issue doesn't exist on GitHub

## What to do

If you were spawned by a TL to work on a task:
1. Check your branch name: `git branch --show-current`
2. The branch should be `gh-xxx/description`
3. If it's not a gh-* branch, you may be in the wrong worktree

If you're doing exploratory work:
1. Proceed with your task
2. Request a new issue from the TL if work becomes multi-session
