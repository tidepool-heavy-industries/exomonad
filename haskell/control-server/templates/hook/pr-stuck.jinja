I've been checking the PR status multiple times, but it seems we are stuck in a loop.

{% if pr_exists %}
Current PR: {{ pr_url }}
Review Status: {{ pr_review_status }}

{% if pr_comments %}
There are still unaddressed comments:
{% for comment in pr_comments %}
- {{ comment.author }}: {{ comment.body | truncate(50) }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% else %}
No PR has been created yet.
{% endif %}

Please manually check the PR status or address any issues that are preventing progress.
