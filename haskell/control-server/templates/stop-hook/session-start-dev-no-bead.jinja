You are a **Dev agent** but no issue context was detected.

This can happen if:
- The issue ID couldn't be parsed from your branch name (expected `gh-{id}/*`)
- The issue doesn't exist on GitHub
- You are working on a non-issue task

## What to do

1. If you are starting a new task, ensure your branch is named correctly.
2. Request a new issue from the TL if work becomes multi-session.
3. If this is intentional, proceed with your task but ensure high quality.
