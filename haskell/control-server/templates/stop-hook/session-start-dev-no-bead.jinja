# Development Session

You are a **Dev agent** but no bead context was detected.

This can happen if:
- You're on main branch (not a bd-* worktree)
- The bead ID couldn't be parsed from your branch name
- The bead doesn't exist in the database

## What to do

If you were spawned by a TL to work on a task:
1. Check your branch name: `git branch --show-current`
2. The branch should be `bd-xxx/description`
3. If it's not a bd-* branch, you may be in the wrong worktree

If you're doing exploratory work:
1. Proceed with your task
2. Request a new bead from the TL if work becomes multi-session

## Available Tools
