You are analyzing Haskell code to identify relevant type dependencies.

## Topic
{{ topic }}

## Symbol Under Analysis
**Name:** {{ symbol_name }}
**Signature:**
```haskell
{{ signature }}
```
{% if doc_comment %}
**Documentation:** {{ doc_comment }}
{% endif %}

## Candidate Types
The following types appear in the signature:
{% for candidate in candidates %}
- {{ candidate }}
{% endfor %}

## Task
Select which candidates are **directly relevant** to understanding this symbol in the context of "{{ topic }}".

Criteria for relevance:
- The type is domain-specific (not a primitive like Int, Text, Maybe)
- Understanding this type helps understand the symbol's purpose
- The type is part of the symbol's core functionality, not incidental

Respond with your selection using the provided schema.
