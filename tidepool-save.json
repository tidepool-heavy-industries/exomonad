She appreciates smart.\n\nCarla settles back. \"Here's what we know: someone's moving through Nighthawk territory without Lampblack permission. Someone's been paying off Bluecoat captains in a way that suggests real coin, not street-level bribery. And someone's been meeting with independent operators—fixers, merchants, people who don't normally align.\"\n\nShe taps the table. \"Lampblack thinks it's a rival house. I think it's worse. I think it's someone building a *third* power base. Not trying to take Crow's Foot outright. Trying to control the flow of information and commerce underneath the visible power structures.\"\n\nCarla leans close. \"Sound like anyone you know?\"\n\nThe implication hangs there. Is she suggesting *you're* the third player? Or is she testing whether you understand what you've already become?\n\n\"What I know,\" Carla continues, \"is that whoever this is, they're smart. Quiet. And they understand that in Doskvol, information is more valuable than territory. Which means they'll want to *own* your podcast, not just listen to it.\"\n\nShe stands. \"You find them before they find you. Because once they know you exist as a tool, they'll either buy you or bury you. And I'd rather you stay breathing.\"\n\nShe leaves a second brass token on the table. \"Same as before. Use it when you have something.\"\n\nYou're alone with Telda, shaking, exhausted, and suddenly understanding that the game just got much deeper than factions fighting over territory.","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["Talk to Telda about what Carla just implied",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"Telda pours you something strong and leans across the bar. Her weathered face is serious in a way you haven't seen before.\n\n\"She wasn't implying you're the third player,\" Telda says quietly. \"She was showing you what you're *becoming*. You didn't go looking to build power. But power doesn't care about your intentions.\"\n\nShe taps the glass. \"You've got Lampblack listening. You've got the Crows listening. You've got street-level people coming to you with information because they think you matter. And you do what? You talk. You broadcast. You make *decisions* about what people hear and when they hear it.\"\n\nTelda's voice drops lower. \"That's not journalism, kid. That's leverage. And leverage is power.\"\n\nShe lets that sit. \"The third player—whoever they are—they already know about you. And they're watching to see if you stay neutral or if you're useful. Right now you're both. But the moment you pick a side? You become a problem to everyone else. Including them.\"\n\nTelda refills her own glass. \"Carla's warning you because she respects what you're building. But she's also telling you the truth: someone's going to come collect. Someone's going to offer you a deal you can't refuse, or threaten you with a consequence you can't survive.\"\n\nShe looks at you directly. \"So the real question is: what do you actually want to be?\"","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["Ask Telda who she thinks the third player is",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"Telda goes quiet for a long moment. She's weighing something—how much to tell you, what you can handle knowing.\n\n\"There's a name that doesn't get spoken in public,\" she finally says. \"Someone who used to run the docks before Lampblack consolidated. A fixer named Basil. Went quiet about two years ago. Everyone assumed dead or fled.\"\n\nShe wipes a glass, methodical. \"But two years ago was also when someone started moving Bluecoat bribes in patterns that didn't match any gang we know. And six months ago was when the independent operators started having better luck avoiding territory disputes.\"\n\nTelda leans in. \"Here's the thing about Basil: they didn't build power through violence. Built it through *connections*. Knew every merchant, every fixer, every person who moved things quietly. If they came back, they wouldn't take territory. They'd take the infrastructure underneath it. The *information channels*.\"\n\nShe pauses. \"Which means a podcast—a neutral voice with reach across all factions—that's either something Basil would want to own, or something Basil already does and is just watching to see what you build.\"\n\nShe meets your eyes. \"Find out if Basil's alive. Find out what they want. And find out *fast*, because the moment Lampblack connects those dots, this whole thing gets violent.\"\n\nYour exhaustion suddenly feels very heavy.","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["Sleep first, investigate Basil after you're functional",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"You wake the next morning with actual clarity. The crash is over. Your hands don't shake. Your thoughts move straight instead of sideways. You're tired, but you're *functional*—which is better than you deserve.\n\nYou spend the day quietly. Eat real food. Drink water. Walk the streets slow, letting your body settle back to baseline. By evening you're thinking clearly enough to know what you're actually looking for.\n\nBasil. Two years disappeared. Now moving Bluecoat money and organizing independent operators. If that's true, they're not just *connected*—they're *dangerous*. The kind of person who builds networks instead of armies.\n\nYour podcast is exactly the kind of tool someone like that would want. Which means either:\n\nOne: Basil already knows about you and is deciding whether to approach.\n\nTwo: Basil doesn't know yet, and you need to find them first before Lampblack does.\n\nThree: Basil's already gone again, and you're chasing a ghost while real problems circle closer.\n\nThe clocks are ticking. The spirit well rupture is getting worse—you can feel the wrongness in the air now, a constant low pressure. The Bluecoats are definitely moving. And the gang war hasn't erupted yet, but it's inches away.\n\nYou've got maybe a week before something breaks.","tag":"DMNarration"}],"sceneLocation":"leaky-bucket","scenePresent":["telda"],"sceneStakes":"Find out what's happening in Crow's Foot"},"sessionGoals":["Establish yourself in Crow's Foot","Pick a side (or play them against each other)","Survive the coming storm"],"sessionHistory":[],"threads":[{"threadDeadline":"gang-war-erupts","threadHook":"With Roric dead, the Crows are weak.
