Gas-lamps hiss in corners, casting long shadows across scarred wooden tables. It's mid-afternoon—the lull between lunch drinkers and evening crews—but the place still bristles with tension.\n\nTelda wipes a glass with a rag that's seen better years. Behind her, bottles catch the lamplight. The tavern is more crowded than it should be for this hour. You clock faces you recognize: two Crows in a back booth nursing drinks and something darker—anger, probably, given what happened to Roric. Three figures in the corner you don't place, but they have the bearing of people who *want* to be noticed. A lone drinker at the bar nursing a finger of bourbon, watching the room like it owes him money.\n\nTelda's smile doesn't reach her eyes. \"Territory's getting thin around here. Everyone's smelling blood.\" She sets down a glass hard enough to make a point. \"What brings you?\"\n\nThe active threads of Crow's Foot hum beneath the surface: someone *will* absorb the Crows' territory. The question is who. And everyone knows the Leaky Bucket—the last neutral ground—is the prize that makes it matter.","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["n\t",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"Telda leans on the bar, waiting. The tavern settles around you—voices low, tension high. The Crows in the back booth eye you briefly, then look away. The strangers in the corner don't bother looking away.","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["nnnnn",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"You settle onto a stool at the bar. \"Bourbon,\" you tell Telda. She pours without comment—a decent measure, not watered. The coin disappears.\n\nYou sip and listen. The tavern hums with low conversation.\n\nFrom the back booth, one of the Crows—scarred face, missing two fingers on his left hand—mutters something to his companion. You catch fragments: \"...can't hold Tanners' and the Docks both...\" and \"...Lampblacks won't wait...\"\n\nThe three strangers in the corner are quieter, but more deliberate. One of them—sharp-featured, pale eyes—keeps glancing toward the Crows, then away. Calculating. The other two have the look of muscle.\n\nTelda returns to polishing glasses. She works methodically, slow. Then, quiet enough that only you hear it: \"Roric's death made a hole. Hole that size? Things rush in to fill it. Some of those things—\" she glances at the corner table, \"—aren't from around here.\"\n\nShe doesn't say more. Doesn't need to.\n\nThe bourbon is smooth. The tension is sharper.","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["n",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"The tavern shifts subtly. The pale-eyed stranger in the corner catches your eye for just a moment—long enough to register that you've been noticed, not long enough to seem accidental. He leans back and murmurs something to one of his companions.\n\nOne of the Crows in the booth stands abruptly, chair scraping loud against the floorboards. His companion grabs his wrist, but he shakes it off. \"Screw this,\" you hear him growl. He heads for the door without looking back.\n\nTelda's jaw tightens. She continues polishing the glass in her hands, but her movements become sharper, more precise. The kind of precision that comes from muscle memory built on keeping the peace.\n\nThe remaining Crow sits alone now, shoulders hunched. The strangers are still watching. The lone drinker at the bar hasn't moved, but his hand has drifted closer to his lap.\n\nThe air in the Leaky Bucket has gotten thinner. Lighter. The kind of light that comes just before something breaks.\n\nTelda glances at you, then away. An invitation. A warning. Or both.","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["n",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"The silence stretches. The remaining Crow finishes his drink with deliberate slowness, then stands. He doesn't leave—instead, he turns and locks eyes with the pale-eyed stranger across the tavern. For a moment, nothing moves. Then the Crow nods slightly, almost imperceptible, and walks toward the door. Careful. Not running.\n\nThe pale-eyed stranger watches him go, jaw tight. He says something sharp to his muscle, and one of them half-rises—but he waves them down with a sharp gesture. Not yet.\n\nTelda sets down her glass. She turns to you directly now, her warm tavern-keeper mask sliding aside just enough to show the calculation underneath.\n\n\"You're still here,\" she says. Not a question. \"That means you're either looking for something, or you're not smart enough to leave when the water's rising.\" She glances at the corner table, then back to you. \"The Lampblacks are moving. Quietly. Testing the edges. Those three—\" she tilts her head toward the strangers, \"—they're not Lampblacks. Not Crows. Not anyone I know. And in Crow's Foot, that's the dangerous kind of new.\"\n\nShe leans closer, voice dropping. \"Roric's hole doesn't fill itself. And whoever fills it owns this place. Owns the Bucket.\" Her eyes are serious now. \"What are you doing in the middle of that?\"","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["nnnnnn",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"You don't answer. Just sip your bourbon and hold her gaze.\n\nTelda's expression doesn't shift, but something flickers behind her eyes—assessment, maybe. She nods slowly, like that silence told her what she needed to know, and steps back to polish another glass.\n\nThe pale-eyed stranger stands. He leaves coins on the table with deliberate care, and his two companions follow. As they move toward the door, he passes close enough to the bar that you catch the faint smell of expensive coat and something metallic underneath. He doesn't look at you. Doesn't need to. You feel his attention like a hand on the back of your neck.\n\nWhen the door closes behind them, the tavern exhales.\n\nTelda doesn't look up from her work. \"They're from the Sparkwraiths,\" she says quietly. \"Or they work for someone the Wraiths answer to. Ghost-dealers, looking to set up territory. Word is they don't negotiate much.\" She finally glances at you. \"Word is they're interested in places like this. Places that matter.\"\n\nThe lone drinker at the bar finishes his bourbon and leaves without paying. Telda lets him go.\n\n\"If you're staying in Crow's Foot,\" she adds, \"you should know which way the wind's blowing. Before it knocks you down.\"","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"You finish your bourbon and slip off the stool. The remaining Crow hasn't moved—he's still hunched over an empty glass, staring into it like it holds answers. His scarred knuckles rest on the table, white with tension.\n\nTelda watches you move, says nothing. A neutral keeper's prerogative.\n\nAs you approach his booth, the Crow's shoulders stiffen. He doesn't look up, but you hear him: \"Sit or don't. But make it quick.\"\n\nHis voice is rough, worn. The kind of tired that doesn't come from sleep. His missing fingers catch the lamplight—old wounds, or recent ones? Hard to say. But the way he grips the edge of the table with what's left of his hand suggests he's used to working around the loss.\n\nHe finally glances up at you. His eyes are hard, but there's something cracked underneath. Something breaking.\n\n\"You a friend of Roric's, or you just here to watch the show?\"","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["man idk im just here to aura farm",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"You slide into the booth across from him without answering directly. Just... sit. Absorb. The Crow lets out a low, rough laugh—more exhale than actual humor.\n\n\"Aura farming,\" he repeats, like he's testing the words. \"Yeah. That's one way to put it.\"\n\nHe signals Telda with two fingers. She brings another glass and pours bourbon without asking questions. The Crow pushes it toward you.\n\n\"Name's Carse,\" he says, turning the empty glass in his remaining fingers. \"Was with Roric. Now I'm with... nobody. That's the problem, yeah? The Crows are scattered. Roric held us together. Held the territory. Now the Lampblacks smell it, the Sparkwraiths are sniffing around, and every two-bit operator with ambition thinks they can carve out a piece.\"\n\nHe takes a drink. His shoulders seem heavier now that someone's actually sitting with him.\n\n\"You just sitting here to soak it all in, or are you waiting for something?\" His eyes are sharper now, less cracked. Like the bourbon and company are steadying something in him. \"Because whatever's coming—and something *is* coming—this tavern's going to be at the center of it. Telda knows it. I know it. Pretty soon, everyone's going to know it.\"","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["soaking it in man this is my spa",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"Carse lets out another rough laugh—longer this time. Real. He settles back into the booth, the tension in his shoulders loosening by degrees.\n\n\"Fair enough,\" he says, raising his glass to you. \"At least someone's being honest about what this is.\"\n\nYou drink. Carse drinks. The Leaky Bucket hums around you—Telda moving between bottles and glasses, the hiss of the gas-lamps, the occasional clink of coin on wood. Outside, Crow's Foot continues its slow dismemberment. Inside, you're just two people at a table, letting the world move without them for a moment.\n\nCarse stares into his glass. \"Roric was good at this,\" he says quietly. \"Holding territory. Holding people. Now there's nobody holding nothing.\" He looks at you sideways. \"The ones that fill the hole—they're not going to be kind about it. The Lampblacks, the Wraiths, whoever else gets hungry—they're going to tear through here like gas-lamps through fog.\"\n\nHe pauses. Takes another drink.\n\n\"Your spa's about to get very crowded.
