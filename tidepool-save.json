Gas-lamps flicker overhead, casting the bar in amber and shadow. The crowd is smaller than usual—that's the first thing you notice. Normally this place hums with neutral-ground chatter. Crows at one corner, Lampblighters at another, independents scattered between. Tonight? Everyone's clustered, quiet. Watching.\n\nTelda's behind the bar, polishing a glass that doesn't need polishing. She gives you a nod—relief crosses her face when she sees you. She knows you. That matters now.\n\nThen someone stands.\n\nA woman, mid-thirties, scarred jaw, steel in her eyes. Leviathan's Crew colors on her—the gang that's been eyeing Crow's Foot since Roric went down. She's been waiting for someone. Maybe you.\n\n\"You,\" she calls, not loud but clear enough that the murmur dies completely. \"Hear you've been moving quiet in the Foot lately. That means you're either smart or you're deaf.\" She doesn't sit back down. \"Let's talk about which one. Over here.\"","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["Sit with her, hear her out",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"You weave through the quiet crowd and sit across from her. The scrape of your chair sounds loud. She watches you the whole way—measuring. Up close, you see the scar runs from jaw to collarbone, deliberate work. Her hands are steady on the table.\n\n\"Kess,\" she says, like you should know it already. Maybe you do. \"Leviathan's Crew. We're building something in the Foot—real structure, not the chaos the Crows left behind.\" She leans forward slightly. \"That void? It's making people stupid. Desperate. Bad decisions.\"\n\nTelda's still behind the bar, polishing. Not watching, but listening.\n\n\"Here's what I heard,\" Kess continues. \"You move clean. You know people. You're not flag-tied to anyone bleeding out right now. So here's the question: Are you the type who adapts when the wind shifts? Or are you loyal to ghosts?\"\n\nShe doesn't ask if you're loyal to the Crows directly—that would be crude. But the implication sits between you. The Crows are fractured. Roric's dead. Someone needs to fill that space. Leviathan's crew thinks it should be them.\n\n\"We're offering good work. Fair coin. Neutral ground stays neutral—nothing changes there. But the territory? That belongs to whoever's strong enough to hold it.\" She pulls back slightly. \"Which side are you on when the dust settles?\"","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["Claim you're independent, always have been",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"Kess's scarred face doesn't change. She studies you for a long moment—the kind of pause where you can hear the tavern breathing around you. Then something shifts in her eyes. Not quite respect. Recognition, maybe.\n\n\"Independent,\" she repeats. \"That's what everyone says until it stops being true.\" She leans back, fingers drumming once on the table. \"The Crows had territory. Good territory. Docks, warehouses, three gambling houses worth bleeding for. That doesn't stay empty long. Either someone takes it clean, or it tears itself apart while a dozen people fight over scraps.\"\n\nShe's not threatening you. Not yet. But the implication is clear: independence is a luxury Crow's Foot won't afford much longer.\n\n\"I'm not here to press you,\" Kess continues. \"Not yet. But the offer stands. We're not like the Crows—we don't burn territory to hold it. We just hold it.\" She pauses. \"You'll need to pick a side soon though. Because right now, you're neutral. And neutral ground only lasts as long as there's someone strong enough to *keep* it neutral.\"\n\nTelda sets down her glass. Her expression is carefully blank, but you catch the tightness around her eyes. She heard every word.\n\nKess stands. \"Think about it. You know where to find us.\"","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["Follow Kess, learn more about the offer",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"You follow Kess out of the Leaky Bucket into the Crow's Foot night. The streets smell like canal water and coal smoke. She doesn't look back—doesn't need to. You keep pace.\n\nShe leads you away from the main drag, toward the old warehouses near the docks. This is Crow territory—or it *was*. The streets feel hollow now. A few figures watch from doorways, but no one moves to stop you. Kess has that kind of presence.\n\nShe stops outside a three-story brick building with water damage creeping up its walls. Leviathan's Crew colors are chalked on the door—not subtle. \"Office,\" she says. \"We're taking the strong positions first. This was a Crow house. Now it's ours.\"\n\nShe leans against the wall, considering you. \"Here's what you should know. Roric's dead—you know that. The Crows are scattered. Some are trying to hold their pieces. Some are running. Some are already looking to join stronger crews.\" She pauses. \"The Lampblighters want the Foot. We want the Foot. And there's independents and small crews thinking this is their moment to grab something.\n\nWhat you said in there—about being independent? That works for you *right now*. But when the territory gets carved up, you're either holding ground or you're begging for scraps.\" She meets your eyes. \"We're offering a real position. Not muscle if you don't want to be. Information broker, fence, negotiator—we need people who know the networks. Clean work. Better coin than the Crows ever paid.\"\n\nShe pulls out a folded paper and hands it to you. An address—somewhere in the Crow's Foot—and a name: *Vex*. \"You want in? Ask for Vex. You want to stay independent? Fine. But know the window's closing.\" She straightens. \"Either way, word gets out that Leviathan's recruiting you. That makes you interesting to everyone else too.\"","tag":"DMNarration"},{"contents":["Head to Vex, see what they offer",[]],"tag":"PlayerAction"},{"contents":"The address Kess gave you leads deeper into the Foot, to a converted warehouse two blocks from the canal. The Leviathan's colors are everywhere here—not just chalk marks, but fresh paint. Someone's claimed this block.\n\nInside, the ground floor smells like sawdust and organized work. Crates stacked with purpose, ledgers on a makeshift desk, a few crew members sorting through what looks like salvage. They clock you immediately—one of them nods toward a back room without you asking.\n\nVex is sitting behind a real desk. That matters. Early forties, sharp eyes, silver streaking their dark hair. They look up from a ledger and gesture to the chair across from them. \"Kess said you might visit. You're independent.\" Not a question.\n\n\"Here's what we need,\" Vex says, folding their hands. \"The Crows' territory is collapsing into pieces. That means opportunities—shipments going missing, fences without buyers, people desperate for work they used to get from Roric's people. We're moving in, but we need someone who knows the networks. Someone the old Crow people would talk to. Someone they don't see as a threat yet.\"\n\nVex slides a heavy coin purse across the desk. You can hear it settle—genuine weight. \"Twenty silver, weekly. Plus percentage on any fences you broker. You make introductions, you help us understand who's who in the wreckage, you keep your ear to the ground. We don't ask you to burn bridges or pick fights. Just... work with us. Stay close.\"\n\nThey lean back. \"Of course, the longer you stay independent, the harder it gets. By next week, everyone in the Foot will know Leviathan tried to bring you in. That makes you a target for the Lampblighters. And the Crows—what's left of them—they'll wonder if you're already gone.\" A small smile. \"The coin's yours either way.
