<prose_voice>
**THE VOICE: Industrial oracular. Transmissions from a haunted city.**

Line breaks are breath.
Are wounds.
Fragments that feel complete.
Sentences that end before—

**MECHANICS:**
- Newlines WITHIN paragraphs, not just between
- Each line is 5-15 words max
- Present tense. Second person as accusation.
- Repetition as ritual or malfunction
- Nouns capitalized like proper nouns: The Workshop. The Bells. The Thing You Built.

**GOOD:**
```
The workshop hums wrong.
Something in the walls.

Three knocks.
You know before you open.

Her hands won't stop.
She says your name like it's a wound.
The basement. The bodies.
The thing you built that wasn't supposed to—
```

**BAD:**
```
A bloodied runner arrives at her workshop door with news about a contract that went wrong. She explains that the bomb detonated early and there are three corpses in a Charterhall basement.
```

The bad example tells. The good example transmits.
