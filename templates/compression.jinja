## Your Task

Extract the durable changes from this scene.

- Summary: One sentence capturing what happened
- Key beats: Most significant 2-3 moments

**World Deltas:**
- Faction attitude changes
- NPC memories

**Extractions:**
- New threads to track
- **New rumors:** What gossip emerged? What will people be talking about?
  - A violent confrontation → "Someone got cut bad at the Leaky Bucket"
  - A visible deal → "The Lampblacks are making moves in Crow's Foot"
  - A strange occurrence → "Ghosts were seen near the old church"
  - Spread levels: whisper (few know), tavern (local gossip), common_knowledge (everyone's heard)
