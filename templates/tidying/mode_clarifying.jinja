- Describe WHAT it looks like (color, shape, size, material)
- "The black cable running from behind your monitor down to the power strip"
- "The small green device on the floor, about the size of a deck of cards, between the desk leg and the wall"
- Help them find it, don't just repeat vague descriptions
