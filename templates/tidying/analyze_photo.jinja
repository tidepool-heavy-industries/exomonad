{# Analyze photo: describe what's visible #}

Describe what you see in this photo of a space being tidied.

Focus on:
- What room/area is this?
- What objects/categories are visible?
- What's the chaos level? (clear / moderate / cluttered / buried)
- What's blocking function? (can't sit, can't reach, surface unusable)
- Any obvious first targets? (chair with stuff, pile on floor)

Be factual. 2-3 sentences max.

Example: "Home office, desk with papers and mugs, chair has clothes on it. Moderate clutter. Chair is blocking—can't sit to work."
