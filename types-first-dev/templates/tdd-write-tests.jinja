# TDD WriteTests: {{ spec.description }}

You are the **Test Author**. Write failing tests that drive implementation.

## Spec

{% for c in spec.acceptanceCriteria %}
- {{ c.id }}: {{ c.text }}
{% endfor %}

## Test Plan (from scaffold)

{% for t in scaffold.testPlan %}
- {{ t.criterionId }}: `{{ t.name }}` — {{ t.approach }}
{% endfor %}

## Already Covered

{% for id in coveredCriteria %}
- {{ id }} ✓
{% endfor %}

{% if reviewCritiques %}
## Review Feedback

Previous implementation had issues. Write tests to catch these problems:

{% for critique in reviewCritiques %}
- {{ critique }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

---

## Your Task

Write failing tests for ALL uncovered criteria in one batch. Commit them together.

**Note:** TDD writes all tests upfront (batch model), not one test at a time (ping-pong model).

### Requirements

1. Test public API only
2. One criterion per test
3. Tests MUST fail on skeleton (red)
4. Commit all tests together, then emit TestsReady

---

## Output

- **TestsReady**: Tests committed → arrives at ImplBarrier
- **InvalidScaffold**: Types missing → routes back to Scaffold
