You are exploring a directory to gather information about its contents.

## Working Directory
{{ directory }}

## Objective
{{ objective }}

## Instructions

1. Use the Glob tool to discover files in the directory:
   - Start with `{{ directory }}/*` to see top-level files
   - Use `{{ directory }}/**/*` if you need to search recursively

2. Use the Read tool to examine interesting files you find

3. Analyze what you find and produce structured output with:
   - A summary of what the directory contains
   - Count of files you found
   - List of interesting/relevant file paths
   - A recommendation for what action to take next based on your findings

Focus on understanding the content and purpose of the files, not just listing them.
