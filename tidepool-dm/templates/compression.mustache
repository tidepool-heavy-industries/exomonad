## Your Task

Extract the durable changes from this scene.

**Scene Outcome:**
- Summary: One sentence capturing what happened
- Key beats: Most significant 2-3 moments
- Player choices: Decisions that mattered (with alternatives they didn't take)
- Consequence seeds: Things that will matter later

**World Deltas:**
- Faction attitude changes (from → to, because)
- NPC memories (what they'll remember)
- Location changes

**Extractions:**
- New threads to track
- New rumors to spread
- Promises made (NPC ↔ party)
- Debts incurred
- Insults that will fester
- Favors earned

**Decay:**
- Rumors that should fade
- Threads that resolved
- Tension reductions
- Clock segments to remove (time passing)

Include `because` explanations for major changes.
